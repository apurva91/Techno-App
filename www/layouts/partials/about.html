    <p id="text" class="about_text">
      Technothlon is an international school championship organized by the student fraternity of IIT Guwahati. Technothlon began in 2004 in a small room with an aim to Inspire Young Minds. Starting on our journey with a participation of 200 students confined to the city of Guwahati, over the past 14 years we have expanded our reach to over 400 cities all over India and various centers abroad. 
      <br>The championship is organized over 2 rounds:<br>
      <b>Prelims:</b> a written preliminary examination which takes place in numerous schools all over India in the month of July.<br><b>Mains:</b> an event based competition which is conducted at IIT Guwahati, among the top 100 students from each squad.

        I saw your questions, and it is good that I don't have to appear in that. It's very tough and very very challenging and you are targeting the best brains.
        <br>The "Best Brains" need the challenge!

        <br> <br> <b>Shubham Jain (AIR 56, IITJEE 2012)</b><br> <br>It was my trip to IIT Guwahati in 2009 for Technothlon that motivated me and helped me achieve such a wonderful rank. I look to participate again in Techniche.
